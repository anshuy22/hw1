  <h2>Our Brand Culture</h2>
  <p>Our brand culture holds strong roots and game-changing visions. It stems from an array of influences and values:
      <ul>
      <li>Our vision to create a no-nonsense product and brand</li>
      <li>Our dedication to researching and establishing sustainable practices and sharing this knowledge with our peers</li> 
      <li>Our relationship with our people, our suppliers and our tribe</li>
      </ul>
  </p>


  <h2>Our People</h2>
  <p>
  We’re one small, happy family at Healthy Soapz, and we want to keep it that way. Our people’s wellbeing is very important to us, <br>so we always do what we can to make work feel less like, well, work. And as much as we love all the nice smells around <br> the office, we regularly swap them for some fresh air and a well-deserved day out.
